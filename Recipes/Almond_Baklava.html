<p> Turkish almond baklava is a delectable variation of the classic Middle Eastern dessert, renowned for its flaky layers of phyllo pastry, rich almond filling, and the sweet, fragrant syrup that binds it all together. 
    This version stands out by incorporating finely ground almonds into the layers, offering a nuttier taste and a slightly different texture from the traditional baklava, which commonly relies on pistachios or walnuts. 
    The preparation of almond baklava involves meticulous layering of thin phyllo sheets, each brushed with melted butter, interspersed with generous amounts of almond mixture. 
    Once baked to golden perfection, the pastry is drenched in a syrup made from sugar, water, lemon juice, and often a touch of rosewater or orange blossom water, enhancing its flavor profile with a subtle floral aroma.
</p>

<p> Serving as a staple in Turkish celebrations and festivities, almond baklava is not just a dessert but a symbol of hospitality and refinement. 
    Its origins can be traced back to the Ottoman Empire, showcasing the rich culinary heritage of Turkey and its neighboring regions. 
    Enjoyed with a cup of strong Turkish tea or coffee, this version of baklava offers a delightful crunch followed by the soothing sweetness of the syrup, making every bite a luxurious experience. 
    The contrast between the crispy layers and the soft, fragrant filling, combined with the distinct presence of almonds, turns this dessert into an unforgettable culinary delight. 
    Whether it’s served as a special treat during Ramadan, at weddings, or as a warm welcome to guests, Turkish almond baklava remains a cherished confection that epitomizes the artistry and tradition of Turkish sweets. </h3>

<ol>
<li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a saucepan over medium heat, combine 2 cups sugar, water, honey, cinnamon stick, lemon and vanilla. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 15 minutes, skimming any foam that is formed. Set side. </li>
<br>
<li> In a small bowl, combine chopped almonds, 2 tablespoons sugar, ground cinnamon and cloves; set aside. Brush butter on bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. Each sheet of phyllo dough is twice as big as the pan, so cut each in half, making 2 sheets. Place a sheet of phyllo on bottom of pan, and brush with melted butter. Repeat process for a total of 8 sheets, buttering each. Sprinkle about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of nut mixture evenly over the phyllo, and cover with 4 more sheets, buttering each. Continue sprinkling nuts after every 4 sheets of phyllo, until all but 8 sheets (4 full sheets) are used. </li>
<br>
<li> Use remaining 8 sheets for the top layer, buttering each sheet of phyllo. Before buttering the last sheet, tuck in any loose edges. Press down layers with palms of your hands. Pour remaining butter over the top. With a large knife, cut 5 strips lengthwise about 1/2 inch deep, then cut diagonally to form diamond shapes. </li>
<br>
<li> Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven, and immediately pour syrup over baklava. Allow to cool thoroughly. Cut diamonds to go all the way through, and serve.</li>
</ol>
